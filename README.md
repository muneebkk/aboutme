# 👋 Hi, I'm Muneeb Kamran

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, also pursuing a minor in Statistics. I love building practical tech that solves real problems — whether that’s fullstack platforms, AI-powered tools, or interactive systems in game engines.

Right now, I’m focused on becoming a well-rounded developer by experimenting with different stacks, working with clubs/startups, and constantly learning from projects.
